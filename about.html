<h2>Doctor Profile: Stephen R Haught DDS</h2>

After 12??? years serving our military as a Dentist in the US Army Dental Corps, Dr. Haught established Emporia Orthodontics in 1983????.<br> 
Dr. Haught’s a bit of a jokester and has a flair for dramatics by putting on a little song-and-dance, telling a tall tale, or launching into a monologue comedy bit. Will he be wearing interesting socks? Will he be in costume? What’s the day’s joke or story? Has he been to the Emporia Zoo recently for a fresh collection of poo for his poo glue?<br>
Dr. Haught’s serious about improving smiles, correcting oral function, and enhancing confidence and self-esteem through Orthodontics. With over 40 years experience, generations of Emporians have trusted their care in Dr. Haught and Emporia Orthodontics. He has treated the grandchildren and children of his patients! <br>
He is strongly committed to improving lives and sense of community with his lifetime service to volunteering and community involvement. Dr. Haught proudly donates his time, energy, ideas, and money to bettering many communities and organizations. He served as President of the Kansas Dental Board (the State’s dental licensing agency). He is very active in the dental community through membership in American Association of Orthodontists, and Kansas Dental Association, and regularly proctors dental licensing exams through ADEX and CRDTS dental testing services. He is a proud member of the Emporia Lions Club and First Congregational Church. He served on many Leadership Boards and Committees for countless non-profit organizations - Boy Scouts of America, United Way, 4-H, Emporia David Taylor Zoo, etc. *insert more names*<br>
He continues to negotiate annual marriage vow renewals with his high school sweetheart, Nina. Together, they raised three children in Emporia, and have six grandchildren in Colorado, Kansas, and Oregon. He has run countless miles through Emporia, ridden his bicycle across Kansas, flown small aircraft, driven many interesting cars, enjoys woodworking/making furniture/remodel projects, photography, collecting art, snow skiing, and traveling.</p>
