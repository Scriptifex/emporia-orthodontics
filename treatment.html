<h1>What to Expect</h1>
<h2>Consultation Appointment:</h2>
<p>Patients and families will have a thorough oral exam and discussion of concerns and goals for Orthodontic treatment. This is an opportunity to meet Dr. Haught and staff, have an office tour, learn about Orthodontics, and better understand treatment options, fees, payment arrangements, insurance coverage, and length of treatment time.</p>

<h2>Records Appointment:</h2>
<p>The first step of undergoing Orthodontics: clinical photos, impressions of teeth, and prepare for initiating treatment.</p>

<h2>Start of Treatment:</h2> 
<p>The big day to apply the orthodontic appliances: brackets, bands, arch wires, deliver appliances, and review instructions</p> 

<h3>Starting Invisalign:</h3>
<p>Invisalign aligners typically require application of clear composite “buttons” on the teeth. This is a painless process. Patients receive the first few aligner trays and instructions.</p>

<h2>Regular Treatment Appointments:</h2> 
<p>Patients will have regular, scheduled treatment appointments every 4-6 weeks to change arch wires or aligner trays to progress through the orthodontic treatment plan.</p>

<h2>Emergency Care:</h2>
<p>Oops! Sometimes a bracket comes loose, an arch wire pokes into the cheek, or a mishap happens with an aligner tray. Please call the office, as soon as possible, to discuss the problem and arrange for an appointment to address the concern.</p>

<h2>End of Treatment:</h2>
<p>The time has come to end active treatment. We love to see the end results. This is when the braces or aligner buttons are removed. Typically, impressions are made for retainers and photos are taken. This is not “GoodBye” but more of a See-You-Later type of appointment.</p>

<h2>Retainer Checks:</h2>
<p>Be sure to regularly wear those retainers and come in for periodic retainer checks. We love to talk to our former patients, see how the smile looks, and get an update about how life is going. So, don’t be a stranger!</p>

<h1>Regular Dental Care:</h1>
<p>Patients should maintain regular appointments with their General Dentist. It is very important to have dental cleanings (prophy) every 3, 4, or 6 months while undergoing active orthodontics. The teeth and gums can become irritated, bleedy, and inflamed when braces are worn. Regular professional cleanings help keep gums healthy. Also, annual dental exams are needed to check for any cavities.</p> 

<h2>Daily Home Care:</h2>
<p>It is very important, critical, and essential that patients thoroughly brush their teeth two to three times EVERY day. Patients must brush and remove food, plaque, and bacteria from their teeth and gums. <br>
Brush every morning (to freshen morning dragon breath and keep your friends)<br>
Brush after meals (so that we can’t see that you ate spinach or broccoli)<br>
Brush every night (clean off the day’s build up of bacteria, plaque, and food)<br>
A soft or ultra-soft toothbrush is recommended. Sometimes a small (toddler-sized) toothbrush head can help clean the back teeth or other tight, hard-to-reach areas.<br>
It is helpful to use several cleaning tools - such as proxa brushes, water piks, antimicrobial oral rinses (alcohol-free), tongue scrapers, floss threaders to get under and around brackets, and arch wires.<br>
Toothpaste brands: CloSys, Sensodyne, MI Paste, or prescription Fluoride toothpaste (Prevident or other 5000ppm NaF toothpaste from pharmacy)<br>
If plaque isn’t regularly cleaned off: cavities, damage, and hypomineralization of the enamel can occur. This is preventable oral disease!!!<br></p>

<h2>Foods to Avoid:</h2>

Popcorn, Jolly Ranchers/hard candies, AirHeads/chewy candies, Super tough and hard foods (beef jerky may be too tough)
